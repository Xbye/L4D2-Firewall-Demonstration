I have been working on re-writing my firewall that I made for my L4D2 servers from a year ago, to incoporate new knowledge and condense things dramatically. However, in writing the IPTables version I ran into a small wall which encouraged me to start researching NFTables.

I have **manually** translated rules from IPTables to NFTables, using knowledge I researched, reading through documentation, and asking in IRC channels due to NFTables documentation being incredibly poor.

Both firewalls are **<ins>UNFINISHED</ins>** and will not work properly as is. They are placed here to allow people to study between IPTables and NFTables. There are a few rules that I explicitely did **not** list in both of these.
